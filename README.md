The registration functionality provides a secure and user-friendly interface for new users to create an account, accessible via the /register route. The process is highly secured by server-side logic which first runs a dedicated middleware array to validate and sanitize 
all submitted data, enforcing strict rules like minimum password length (8 characters), complexity (requiring mixed case, numbers, and symbols), and valid email formatting. If any validation fails, the user is immediately redirected back to the form with specific error 
messages. Upon successful validation, the user's password is then securely hashed using bcrypt before the data is inserted into the users table. This design ensures that the system never stores a plain-text password and utilizes the database's UNIQUE constraints to 
gracefully handle duplicate entries, informing the user if the username or email already exists. Finally, the user is redirected to the /login page upon successful account creation.
