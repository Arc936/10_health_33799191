-- Outline --
The Health & Fitness Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users log, visualize, 
and track their personal wellness data. Built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templates, the application 
provides a secure, session-based user experience. Upon registration and login, users gain access to 
personalized data entry forms. Key features include logging specific daily workouts, tracking body metrics 
, and viewing a centralized dashboard of their personal history. The application uses a robust MySQL database
to ensure data persistence and integrity. Security is prioritized through the use of environment variables 
for database credentials, bcrypt for password hashing, and session management for authentication, 
ensuring that each user’s data is private and restricted to their session ID. Additionally, a public search 
library allows users to browse pre-defined workout types without needing to log in.

-- Data model --

The database schema uses five main tables connected via one-to-many relationships.

users: Stores user credentials and basic profile information.

login_attempts: An audit table tracking login successes and failures.

excersizes: A static library of defined activities (Cardio, Strength, etc.).

workouts: Logs specific instances of user activity, linked to users via user_id and potentially to 
exercise types via workout_type_id.

body_metrics: Stores historical measurements like weight, linked to users via user_id.

-- Architecture --

Presentation Tier: Handled by EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates rendered by the Express server.

Application Tier: Managed by Node.js using the Express framework for routing, middleware (sessions, 
body parsing), and business logic (login, data validation, database queries).

Data Tier: A MySQL database securely stores all persistent data (user accounts, workout logs, body metrics). 
The application connects to this tier using the mysql2 driver.

-- Functionality --
1. User Authentication and Access Control
Access to personalized features is restricted via robust authentication:

Login/Logout: Users must log in via the dedicated form using their username and password. The application utilizes Express Sessions, ensuring that once logged in,
a user's ID is securely stored.

Access Control: The redirectLogin middleware protects sensitive routes like /workout-log and /progress-chart. Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the 
login page, maintaining data privacy.

Audit Logging: Every login attempt (success or failure) is logged to the login_attempts table for security monitoring.
